# SSV Alignment
Alignment workflow built around the excellent [Sync Toolbox](https://github.com/meinard-mueller/synctoolbox) by Meinard MÃ¼ller and colleagues, which does all the heavy lifting.

Used to generate i. audio-to-audio alignments of  many recordings of the same musical piece, and ii. audio-to-score alignments to music encodings in the MEI format. 

Described in [Weigl et al (DLfM 23)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3625135.3625144)

This workflow is under development as part of the [Signature Sound Vienna (SSV)](https://iwk.mdw.ac.at/signature-sound-vienna) project, funded by the [Austrian Science Fund (FWF P 34664-G)](https://pf.fwf.ac.at/en/research-in-practice/project-finder?search%5Bwhat%5D=&search%5Bpromotion_category_id%5D%5B%5D=&search%5Bcall%5D=&search%5Bproject_number%5D=&search%5Bdecision_board_ids%5D=&search%5Bproject_title%5D=&search%5Blead_firstname%5D=&search%5Blead_lastname%5D=Weigl&search%5Bresearch_place_kind%5D%5B%5D=&search%5Bresearch_place_kind%5D%5B%5D=Universit%C3%A4t+f%C3%BCr+Musik+und+darstellende+Kunst+Wien&multiselect=Universit%C3%A4t+f%C3%BCr+Musik+und+darstellende+Kunst+Wien&search%5Binstitute_name%5D=&search%5Bstart_date%5D=&search%5Bend_date%5D=&search%5Bgrant_years%5D%5B%5D=&search%5Bgrant_years%5D%5B%5D=2021&multiselect=2021&search%5Bstatus_id%5D=&search%5Bscience_discipline_id%5D=&search%5Bper_page%5D=10#search-results).

The output is compatible with the [Listen Here!](https://github.com/signature-sound-vienna/listenHere) tool for machine-assisted close listening, also developed as part of this project.
